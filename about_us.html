          Our team consists of 2 main groups. Our first group would be the training 
          personnel which consists of our team of trainers who come from different 
          training institutions and are equipped with the knowledge and skillsets 
          required for teaching AI Analytics. Our second group would be our consultation 
          personnel team which consists of trained professionals who are already 
          using their skills in the working industry. They will be able to provide information
          based on their experience in the field and assist people by improving and enhancing
          their knowledge and skills.</div>

          <p>"Really educational! The trainer I had was really thorough in his explanation
              and I could learn quite easily. The lessons were really engaging and I really 
              like how we are able to participate in writing the codes."</p>

          <p>"Simply amazing! I was able to learn so much through the training as the 
            trainer was so precise with her explanation. I really like the way the 
            lessons were conducted, and I find that the amount of hands-on activities I 
            did really helped me understand more. Overall I am really satisfied."</p>

          <p>"I was doubtful when i chanced upon this site. However, after making a call 
              and asking about the training, i decided and try it out. Currently, I can say 
              that I am trained in AI & Analytics after going through the 3 months training. 
              My trainer was really patient with me, and he answered all my questions with 
              full confidence, which shows his full comprehension in this field. I felt very 
              confident learning from him."</p>
