      <div class="row p-3 bg-secondary text-white rounded shadow-lg">
        <h5>"If I am really bad at computing, can I still learn AI Analytics?"</h5>
        <p>Yes, of course! If you join our training, you will be taught all the basics skills and acquire all the knowledge required.
          Therefore, no prior computing background is necessary. However, it is recommended to do some research on your own as it
          will help give a gauge of what will be covered in the training and give a basic understanding. This will help a lot in 
          your learning during the training sessions.</p>

      <div class="row p-3 bg-secondary text-white rounded shadow-lg">
        <h5>"Is the certificate useful for future employment?"</h5>
        <p>To an extent. Our certificate only proves that you are equipped with the skills and knowledge required for AI Analytics. Majority 
          of the companies are looking for certifications like a diploma or degree. However, it would be helpful if you already have a diploma 
          or a degree but your course of study was not AI related. This would serve as an additional skillset which will help you gain a better 
          chance if you are trying to get into AI Analytics.

      <div class="row p-3 bg-secondary text-white rounded shadow-lg">
        <h5>"Can I ask for a refund if I am unable to attend training after I applied?"</h5>
        <p>Yes, you can! However, we would require you to provide the reason(s) for the refund. On the other hand, we strongly recommend you to 
          carry on with the training if it has already started as it would be beneficial for them to continue learning instead of stopping 
          halfway. Also, by carrying on with the training, you can attempt the examination and have a gauge of how well you have learned 
          from the training.

        <h5>"Can I make changes to my time slots after application?"</h5>
        <p>Yes, you can! For people who have selected the wrong timings or have last minute changes to their schedule, you can refer to our 
          confirmation email which contains the step-by-step guide on how to make amendments to your time slots. Alternatively, you can also 
          send an email or message to Mr James Gordon who is in charge of all training matters. You can find his contact details either in 
          your confirmation email or from our webpage.
